# Sentiment_Analysis

Analyzed 25,000 IMDB reviews using Simple RNN and GRU models, achieving a robust 77.95% overall accuracy with a loss score of 0.506, through comprehensive preprocessing techniques.  


Merged two datasets and balanced them for sentiment analysis training. One is the IMDB movie review dataset from Keras, containing 25,000 labeled reviews as positive or negative. The other is a hotel review dataset from booking.com, comprising over 500,000 customer reviews and ratings for around 1,500 luxury hotels in Europe. 


Tried LSTM, RNN, GRU, Bidirectional RNN. Got the highest accuracy of 92% for bidirectional RNNs but due to other parameters not aligning appropriately, I went ahead with simple RNNs which gave 77,95% accuracy.
